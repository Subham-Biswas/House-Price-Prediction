## About The Model

Using XGBoost Regression the model predicts the price of a house when a set of new features is given.
XGBoost is a boosting technique that sequentially creates decision trees, each tree improving upon the mistakes of the previous one. The final result is a sum of outputs from all the trees. It uses CART algorithm for generating the tree.
